## The story

To bad that it does not fly, it does not spin, nor it race, but it teleported Nico from the future here.

powered pizzeria in New-Zealand.

Nico was in the middle of restructuring his Pizzeria website and decide to enlist the help of you to finish his task.
Part of the work is already done, much needs to be completed, [let's start](/docs/schema)!
